About Get me a Chai
Welcome to Get me a Chai, the platform that connects creators with their supporters in a simple, meaningful way. Inspired by the success of patronage platforms like Patreon, we built Get me a Chai to give creators the tools they need to receive financial support, grow their communities, and build sustainable creative careers—all over a metaphorical chai!

Our Mission
At Get me a Chai, we believe that creative individuals—whether they are artists, writers, podcasters, or hobbyists—deserve a reliable platform to fund their passion. By offering a space for creators to connect directly with their supporters, we empower artists to receive contributions, allowing them to focus more on creating and less on monetization challenges.
